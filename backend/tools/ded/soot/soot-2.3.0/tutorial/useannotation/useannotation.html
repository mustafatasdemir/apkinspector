<P>
This note explains how to use Soot annotation options to add array
bounds check and null pointer check attributes to a class file and
how to use these attributes in a JIT or ahead-of-time compiler.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000">
Array References and Object References</A>
</H1>
Java requires array bounds checks when accessing arrays, and null
pointer checks when accessing objects.  Array bounds checks are
implemented at the virtual machine level by inserting comparison
instructions before accessing an array element.  Most of operating systems
can raise a hardware exception when a bytecode accesses a null
pointer, so the nullness check on an object reference is 
free at most of the time.  However, some bytecodes, like the <I>invokespecial</I> and <TT>athrow</TT> instructions, do need explicit comparison
instructions to detect null pointers.  Both of these safety checking
mechanisms do cause heavy runtime overhead.

<P>
Soot provides static analyses for detecting safe array and object
accesses in a method.  These analyses mark array and object reference bytecodes as
either safe or unsafe.  The results of these analyses are encoded into the
class file as attributes, which can then be understood by an
interpreter or JIT compiler. If a bytecode is marked as safe in its
attribute, the associated comparison instructions can be eliminated.
This can speed up the execution of Java applications. Our process of
encoding class files with attributes is called <EM>annotation</EM>.

<P>
Soot can be used as a compiler framework to support any attributes you
would like to define; they can then be encoded into the class file.
The process of adding new analyses and attributes is documented in
``Adding attributes to class files via Soot''.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
Annotation options in Soot</A>
</H1>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00021000000000000000">
Description of new options</A>
</H2>

<P>
Soot has new command-line options <TT>-annot-nullpointer</TT> and
<TT>-annot-arraybounds</TT> to enable the phases required to emit
null pointer check and array bounds check annotations, respectively.

<P>
Soot has some phase options to configure the annotation process.
These phase options only take effect when annotation is enabled.  
Note that the array bounds check analysis and null pointer
check analysis constitute two different phases, but that the results
are combined and stored in the same attribute in the class files. 

<P>
The null pointer check analysis has the phase name ``<EM>jap.npc</EM>''. It has one phase option (aside from the default option
<EM>enabled</EM>).

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>-p jap.npc only-array-ref</STRONG></DT>
<DD> 
<BR>
By default, all bytecodes that need null pointer checks are 
  annotated with the analysis result. When this option is set to true, 
  Soot will annotate only array reference bytecodes with null 
  pointer check information; other bytecodes, such as <TT>getfield</TT> 
  and <TT>putfield</TT>, will not be annotated. 
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
Soot also has phase options for the array bounds check analysis.
These options affect three levels of analyses: intraprocedural,
class-level, and whole-program. The array bounds check analysis has
the phase name ``<EM>jap.abc</EM>''.  If the whole-program analysis is
required, an extra phase ``<EM>wjap.ra</EM>'' for finding rectangular
arrays is required.  This phase can be also enabled with
phase options.

<P>
By default, our array bounds check analysis is intraprocedual, since
it only examines local variables. This is fast, but
conservative. Other options can improve the analysis result; however,
it will usually take longer to carry out the analysis, and some
options assume that the application is single-threaded.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>-p jap.abc with-cse</STRONG></DT>
<DD> 
<BR>
The analysis will consider common subexpressions.  For example,
  consider the situation where <TT>r1</TT> is assigned <TT>a*b</TT>; later,
  <TT>r2</TT> is assigned <TT>a*b</TT>, where both <TT>a</TT> and <TT>b</TT> have
  not been changed between the two statements. The analysis can
  conclude that <TT>r2</TT> has the same value as <TT>r1</TT>. Experiments
  show that this option can improve the result slightly.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>-p jap.abc with-arrayref</STRONG></DT>
<DD> 
<BR>
With this option enabled, array
references can be considered as common subexpressions; however, we are
more conservative when writing into an array, because array
objects may be aliased. NOTE: We also assume that the application in a
single-threaded program or in a synchronized block. That is, an
array element may not be changed by other threads between two array
references.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>-p jap.abc with-fieldref</STRONG></DT>
<DD> 
<BR>
The analysis treats field references (static and instance) as common
subexpressions. The restrictions from the `<TT>with-arrayref</TT>' option also
apply. 

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>-p jap.abc with-classfield</STRONG></DT>
<DD> 
<BR>
This option makes the analysis work on the class level. The algorithm 
analyzes `final' or `private' class fields first. It can recognize
the fields that hold array objects with constant length.  In an application 
using lots of array fields, this option can improve the analysis results 
dramatically. 

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>-p jap.abc with-all</STRONG></DT>
<DD> 
<BR>
A macro.  Instead of typing a long string of phase options, this option 
will turn on all options of the phase ``<EM>jap.abc</EM>''.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>-p jap.abc with-rectarray, -p wjap.ra with-wholeapp</STRONG></DT>
<DD> 
<BR>
These
two options are used together to make Soot run the whole-program
analysis for rectangular array objects. This analysis is based on the
call graph, and it usually takes a long time. If the application uses
rectangular arrays, these options can improve the analysis
result.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00022000000000000000">
Examples</A>
</H2>

<P>
Annotate the benchmark in class file mode with both analyses.
<PRE>
    java soot.Main -annot-nullpointer -annot-arraybounds spec.benchmarks._222_mpegaudio.Main
</PRE>

<P>
The options for rectangular array should be used in application 
mode. For example:
<PRE>
    java soot.Main --app -annot-arraybounds -annot-arraybounds -p wjap.ra with-wholeapp 
      -p jap.abc with-all spec.benchmarks._222_mpegaudio.Main
</PRE>

<P>
The following command only annotates the array reference bytecodes.
<PRE>
    java soot.Main -annot-arraybounds -annot-arraybounds -jap.npc only-array-ref 
      spec.benchmarks._222_mpegaudio.Main
</PRE>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Using attributes in the Virtual Machine</A>
</H1>
The array bounds check and null pointer check information is encoded 
in a single attribute in a class file. The attribute is called 
<TT>ArrayNullCheckAttribute</TT>. When a VM reads in the class file, 
it can use the attribute to avoid generating comparison instructions for
the safe bounds and nullness checks. 

<P>
All array reference bytecodes, such as <EM>?aload, ?store</EM> will be annotated 
with bounds check information. Bytecodes that need null pointer check 
are listed below:
<PRE>
        ?aload
        ?astore
        getfield
        putfield
        invokevirtual
        invokespecial
        invokeinterface
        arraylength
        monitorenter
        monitorexit
        athrow
</PRE>

<P>
The attributes in the class file are organized as a table. If a method
has been annotated, it will have an <TT>ArrayNullCheckAttribute</TT>
attribute on its <TT>Code_attribute</TT>. The data structure is defined as:

<P>
<PRE>
        array_null_check_attribute
        {
            u2 attribute_name_index;
            u4 attribute_length;
            u3 attribute[attribute_length/3];
        }
</PRE>

<P>
The attribute data consist of 3-byte entries. Each entry has the first two 
bytes indicating the PC of the bytecode it belongs to; the third byte is 
used to represent annotation information.

<P>
<PRE>
        soot_attr_entry
        {
            u2 PC;
            u1 value;
        }
</PRE>

<P>
Entries are sorted by PC in ascending order when written into the class
file. The right-most two bits of the `<EM>value</EM>' byte represent
upper and lower bounds information. The third bit from right is used
for nullness annotation.  Other bits are not used and set to zero. The
bit value `1' indicates the check is needed, and 0 represents a
known-to-be-safe access. In general, only when both lower and upper
bounds are safe can the check instructions be eliminated. However,
sometimes this depends on the VM implementation.

<P>
<PRE>
        0 0 0 0 0 N U L
            N : nullness check
            U : upper bounds check
            L : lower bounds check
</PRE>

<P>
For example, the attribute data should be interpreted as:
<PRE>
    0 0 0 0 0 1 x x    // need null check
    0 0 0 0 0 0 x x    // no null check

    // x x represent array bound check.

    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0    // do not need null check or array bounds check
    0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0    // need null check, but not array bounds check
</PRE>
