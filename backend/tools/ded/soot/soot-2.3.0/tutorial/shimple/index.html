<P>
This document briefly describes Shimple, an SSA variant of Soot's
Jimple internal representation.  It assumes general knowledge of Soot,
Jimple and SSA form. You may wish to jump directly to the walk-through
section for a demonstration of why you might be interested in using
Shimple either by implementing analyses or by applying existing
optimizations.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000">
Why Shimple?</A>
</H1>

<P>
Static Single Assignment (SSA) form guarantees a single static
definition point for every variable used in a program, thereby
significantly simplifying as well as enabling certain analyses.

<P>
Shimple provides you with an IR in SSA form that is almost entirely
identical to Jimple except for the introduction of Phi nodes.  The
idea is that Shimple can be treated almost identically to Jimple with
the added benefits of SSA.  

<P>
For example, the additional variable splitting due to SSA form may
turn a previously flow-insensitive analysis into a flow-sensitive one
with little or no additional work.

<P>

Command Line Walk Through</A>
</H1>

<P>
For fun, you may wish to run Shimple from the command-line and study
its output.  Consider the following (compiled) Java code of the 
<TT>ShimpleTest</TT> class:

<P>
<PRE>
public int test()
{
    int x = 100;
        
    while(doIt){
        if(x &lt; 200)
            x = 100;
        else
            x = 200;
    }

    return x;
}
</PRE>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00041000000000000000">
Producing Jimple</A>
</H2>

<P>
If you produce Jimple with `<TT>soot.Main -f jimple ShimpleTest</TT>' you
obtain the following code for the <TT>test()</TT> method:

<P>
<PRE>
        i0 = 100;
        goto label2;

     label0:
        if i0 &gt;= 200 goto label1;

        i0 = 100;
        goto label2;

     label1:
        i0 = 200;

     label2:
        if $z0 != 0 goto label0;

        return i0;
</PRE>

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00042000000000000000">
Producing Shimple</A>
</H2>

<P>
To produce Shimple instead, use `<TT>soot.Main -f shimple ShimpleTest</TT>':

<P>
<PRE>
        i0 = 100;
(0)     goto label2;

     label0:
        if i0_1 &gt;= 200 goto label1;

        i0_2 = 100;
(1)     goto label2;

     label1:
(2)     i0_3 = 200;

     label2:
        i0_1 = Phi(i0 #0, i0_3 #2, i0_2 #1);
        if $z0 != 0 goto label0;

        return i0_1;
</PRE>

<P>
The difference between the Jimple and Shimple output is that the
latter guarantees unique local definition points in the program (for
scalars).  Notice here that the variable <TT>i0</TT> has been split into
the four variables <TT>i0</TT>, <TT>i0_1</TT>, <TT>i0_2</TT> and <TT>i0_3</TT>,
each with a unique definition point.

<P>
We have also introduced a Phi node.  You can read `<TT>i0_1 = Phi(i0
#0, i0_3 #2, i0_2 #1)</TT>' as saying that <TT>i0_1</TT> will be assigned
value <TT>i0</TT> if control flow comes from unit <TT>#0</TT> <EM>or</EM> it
will be assigned <TT>i0_3</TT> if control flow comes from unit <TT>#2</TT> <EM>or</EM>... and so on.

<P>
If you have a prejudice against variable names with underscores, you
may use `<TT>soot.Main -f shimple -p shimple standard-local-names
ShimpleTest</TT>' instead so that Shimple applies the Local Name
Standardizer each time new locals are introduced.

<P>
Feel free to skip the following digression and move on to the next
subsection.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00042100000000000000">
A Digression on Shimple Pointers</A>
</H3>

<P>
Because Soot represents the body of a method internally as a Unit
chain, we need to store explicit pointers (such as <TT>#0</TT> and <TT>#1</TT> in the above example) to keep track of the control flow
predecessors of the Phi statements.

<P>
Shimple's internal implementation of PatchingChain attempts to move
and maintain these pointers in a manner that will be as transparent as
possible to the user.  For example, in the simplest case, if a
statement is appended to block:

<P>
<PRE>
     label0:
(1)     i0_1 = 1000;
</PRE>

<P>
to obtain:

<P>
<PRE>
     label0:
        i0_1 = 1000;
(1)     new_stmt;
</PRE>

<P>
Shimple will automatically move the <TT>#1</TT> pointer down to the new
statement since it is in the same basic block.

<P>
The intent is to provide maximum flexibility for code motion
optimizations as well as other transformations.  In this case, <TT>i0_1 = 1000</TT> is free to move up or down the Unit chain as long as the
new location dominates the original CFG block it was in.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00043000000000000000">
Producing Jimple, Again</A>
</H2>

<P>
Since we eventually have to get rid of those pesky Phi nodes, you
may wish to see what the code looks like after going from Jimple to
Shimple and back again to Jimple.  Do this with `<TT>java soot.Main -f
jimple -via-shimple ShimpleTest</TT>':

<P>
<PRE>
        i0_1 = 100;
        goto label2;

     label0:
        if i0_1 &gt;= 200 goto label1;

        i0_1 = 100;
        goto label2;

     label1:
        i0_1 = 200;

     label2:
        if $z0 != 0 goto label0;

        return i0_1;
</PRE>

<P>
Happily, in this case, the Jimple produced looks exactly like the
original Jimple code.  As usual you may specify `<TT>-p shimple
standard-local-names</TT>' if the underscores hurt your eyes; they are
otherwise quite harmless.

<P>
To understand what's really going on when Shimple eliminates Phi
nodes, you can tell it to eliminate them naively with `<TT>soot.Main
-f jimple -via-shimple -p shimple phi-elim-opt:none ShimpleTest</TT>':

<P>
<PRE>
        i0 = 100;
        i0_1 = i0;
        goto label2;

     label0:
        if i0_1 &gt;= 200 goto label1;

        i0_2 = 100;
        i0_1 = i0_2;
        goto label2;

     label1:
        i0_3 = 200;
        i0_1 = i0_3;

     label2:
        if $z0 != 0 goto label0;

        return i0_1;
</PRE>

<P>
Now you can see that all Shimple did was to replace the Phi node
with equivalent copy statements.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00044000000000000000">
Applying Shimple Optimizations</A>
</H2>

<P>
So, what good is Shimple?  

<P>
If you were paying attention, you may have noticed that despite the
control flow and different assignments to <TT>x</TT>, <TT>x</TT> is in fact
a constant 100 and is only ever used by a single return statement.  In
other words, all the computations are quite useless and need to be
optimized away.

<P>
Let's try to apply Jimple's Constant Propagator and Folder.  In fact,
to be fair, let's try all the available  Jimple optimizations activated
with `<TT>soot.Main -f jimple -O ShimpleTest</TT>':

<P>
<PRE>
        i0 = 100;
        goto label2;

     label0:
        if i0 &gt;= 200 goto label1;

        i0 = 100;
        goto label2;

     label1:
        i0 = 200;

     label2:
        if $z0 != 0 goto label0;

        return i0;
</PRE>

<P>
As you can see in this case, the Jimple optimizations failed to deduce
that <TT>x</TT> is a constant.  Jimple may be forgiven for this since
reasoning about control flow is not always an easy task to automate.
Shimple, on the other hand, encodes control flow information
explicitly in the Phi nodes thereby allowing optimizations to make use
of the information.

<P>
Currently, the only optimization we have implemented specifically for
Shimple is a version of the powerful constant propagation algorithm
sketched by the Cytron et el.  The implementation can reason about
control flow and can currently handle the conditional branching
statements <TT>IfStmt</TT>, <TT>TableSwitchStmt</TT> and <TT>LookupSwitchStmt</TT>.

<P>
Let's apply it with `<TT>soot.Main -f jimple -via-shimple -O
ShimpleTest</TT>':

<P>
<PRE>
     label0:
        if $z0 != 0 goto label0;

        return 100;
</PRE>

<P>
Et voila, Shimple optimized out the <TT>x</TT> variable completely. What
happened is that the optimization propagated reachable definitions to
the Phi node and then noticed that the Phi node was useless (because
it made a selection from identical values) and therefore trimmed it
out.  In the process, dead code was exposed which was ultimately
eliminated.

<P>
To understand what is really going on, you can look at the output from
`<TT>soot.Main -f shimple -p sop on</TT>', `<TT>soot.Main -f shimple -p sop
on -p sop.cpf prune-cfg:false</TT>' and `<TT>soot.Main -f jimple
-via-shimple -p shimple phi-elim-opt:none -p sop on -p sop.cpf
prune-cfg:false</TT>' on this and other examples:

<P>
<PRE>
public int test2()
{
    int i = 1000;
    int j = 1000;

    while(doIt){
        if(i == j){
            if(anotherIt)
                i = j;
            else
                j = i;
        }
        else{
            i = 5;
            j = 6;
        }
    }

    return i + j;
}
</PRE>

Thanks and Credits</A>
</H1>

<P>
Thanks and credits go alphabetically to Laurie Hendren, John
Jorgensen, Patrick Lam and Ondrej Lhotak for helping with the design
of Shimple and general implementation issues.  I am most grateful for
their help and advice.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00060000000000000000">
Future Work</A>
</H1>

<P>
Much more work on Shimple is planned as the project is likely to morph
into a Master's thesis.  Some thoughts currently include investigating
the various scalar SSA variants as well as heap, array and possibly
concurrent forms of SSA.  The Shimple architecture and implementation
will therefore evolve quite a bit internally, but as far as possible
we will try to maintain backwards-compatibility for the public
interfaces.

<P>
Suggestions, improvements and bug reports/fixes welcome!  Please send
these either to the Soot mailing list at

Known Issues</A>
</H2>

<P>
A vague description of a couple of known issues follows.  You may
ignore this section completely since regular usage of Shimple should
not be affected in general.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00062100000000000000">
Issue 1</A>
</H3>

<P>
One issue is related to Phi nodes inserted at the beginning of try
blocks which are subsequently used by Phi nodes in the corresponding
handler block.  Fortunately, although the code produced looks strange
it is not incorrect.  Example:

<P>
<PRE>
    label1:
        i0_2 = Phi(i0 #0, i0_1 #1);
(2)     i1 = 4 / 0;
(3)     i0_3 = i0_2 / 0;
        i2 = i0_3;

     label2:
        goto label4;

     label3:
        $r0 := @caughtexception;
        i0_4 = Phi(i0_1 #1, i0 #0, i0_2 #2, i0_3 #3);

        catch java.lang.Exception from label1 to label2 with label3;
</PRE>

<P>
The <TT>#2</TT> pointer of the second Phi node really should be pointing
directly at the first Phi node instead of at the statement following
it (since the latter may throw an exception and branch to the handler
block).  Fortunately, in these cases the second Phi node will always
be pointing directly at the predecessors of the first Phi node as well
(<TT>#0</TT> and <TT>#1</TT> in this example), rendering the matter moot.
This glitch will be eliminated in a future release.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00062200000000000000">
Issue 2</A>
</H3>

<P>
Another issue is related to the Shimple patching algorithm.  In the
rare case that control flow falls through from an if statement to a
try block and the if statement has a pointer to it:

<P>
<PRE>
       value = 1000;
(1)    if (whatever) goto label100;

label1:
       first_trap_statement;
       ...
       goto label100;
label2:
       $r0 := @caughtexception;
       i0 = Phi(value #1, ...);
</PRE>

<P>
In the above, it may be desirable to move the #1 pointer down if a
Unit happens to be inserted after the if statement.  Although Shimple
is smart enough to do this in most known cases, it currently misses
the one case where control flows from an if statement in a
non-exceptional context to an exceptional context.

<P>
This is not a big problem for most people unless an exotic code motion
algorithm (currently non-existent in Soot) attempts to move the
definition of <TT>value</TT> below the if statement for some reason.
