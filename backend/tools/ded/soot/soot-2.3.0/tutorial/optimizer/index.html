Goals</A>
</H1>

<P>
This tutorial describes the use of Soot as an optimization tool.  
After completing this tutorial, the user will be able to use Soot
to optimize classfiles and whole applications.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00010010000000000000">
Prerequisites</A>
</H4> The user should have a working installation
of Soot; successful completion of the 
<A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="../intro">introduction</A>
is one way to exercise one's installation of Soot.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00020000000000000000">
Classfile Optimization</A>
</H1>

<P>
Soot is able to optimize individual classfiles.  Some of the transformations
which can be carried out on individual classfiles include:
common subexpression elimination, partial redundency elimination, 
copy propagation, constant propagation and folding, conditional
branch folding, dead assignment elimination, unreachable code elimination,
unconditional branch folding, and unused local
elimination.

<P>
In order to optimize the <TT>Hello</TT> example from the previous tutorial,
we issue the command:

<P>
<PRE>
&gt; java soot.Main -O Hello
Transforming Hello...
</PRE>

<P>
Soot will then leave a new, improved <TT>Hello.class</TT> file in the
<TT>sootOutput</TT> directory.  For this class, the improvement after
Sootification is not so obvious.  Soot does, however, eliminate unused
locals.  Try adding an unused local to <TT>Hello</TT> and giving this command:

<P>
<PRE>
&gt; java soot.Main -O -f jimple Hello
Transforming Hello...
</PRE>

<P>
You should see that the unused local is no longer present.

<P>
Any number of classfiles can be specified to Soot in this mode, as
long as they are in the <TT>CLASSPATH</TT>.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00020010000000000000">
Hidden Trap</A>
</H4> Note that your classfile may belong to some
package; it may be called, for instance, <TT>soot.Scene</TT>.  This
indicates that the <TT>Scene</TT> class belongs to the <TT>soot</TT> package.
It will be in a <TT>soot/</TT> subdirectory.  In order to Sootify this
file, you must be in the parent directory (not <TT>soot/</TT>), and you
must specify <TT>java soot.Main -O soot.Scene</TT>.

<P>
Unfortunately, our current optimizations with <TT>-O</TT> tend to have
little effect on the program execution time.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00030000000000000000">
Program Optimization</A>
</H1>

<P>
Soot provides the <TT>-app</TT> switch to make it work on all the class
files in an applicaion. When this switch is present, the user specifies
the main classfile, and Soot will load all needed classes.

<P>
Soot has a whole-program mode in which allows it to carry out
whole-program transformations; for instance, method inlining requires
the whole program to correctly resolve virtual method calls.

<P>
To specify that Soot should do whole-program optimizations (<TT>-W</TT>),
as well as single-class optimizations, use the command:

<P>
<PRE>
&gt; java soot.Main --app -W Hello
Transforming Hello...
</PRE>

<P>
Soot will write out all classes except those in the <TT>java.*</TT>,
<TT>javax.*</TT> and <TT>sun.*</TT> packages.

<P>
The default behaviour of <TT>-W</TT> is to statically inline methods.
Soot is also capable of static method binding; use 

<P>
<PRE>
&gt; java soot.Main --app -p wjop.smb on -p wjop.si off -W -O
       Hello
</PRE>

<P>
This type of optimization has produced significant speedups on
some benchmarks.
