Dear Soot Users,

We are pleased to announce that Soot version 2.3.0 is now available
at: http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/

This release contains the following additions and improvements:

1. Integrated new JastAdd-based frontend with support for Java 5
   source code. Thanks to Torbjorn Ekman for contributing his
   frontend and his implementation of Java2Jimple!
   
2. At the very least if -validate is on, Soot now checks that @this
   is only assigned in the first statement of an instance method.
   This has always been an implicit assumption for Jimple code
   but up until now was not enforced. 
   
3. Integrated full support for preserving annotations in Jimple
   and writing them to bytecode. SOURCE level annotations are
   preserved if code is read from source and the flag
   -p jb preserve-source-annotations is given. (does not hold for
   package and local variable annotations) SOURCE level annotations
   are not written into bytecode by Soot.
   Annotations can easily be added to SootClass, SootMethod and
   SootField instances using the utility class
   soot.jimple.toolkits.annotation.j5anno.AnnotationGenerator.
   (Thanks to Will Benton!)   
 
4. Java 5 Annotations for fields, classes, parameters and methods
   are now fully preserved in bytecode. Jasmin was changed to
   implement this support.   
   
5. Ben Bellamy contributed a new implementation for the type assigner.
   This is to be published under the title 'Efficient Local Type
   Inference' at OOPSLA '08. The new type assigner is usually
   faster (it is applied when processing bytecode), and sometimes
   more precise. In particular it should always infer the most
   narrow type possible.   
   
Also we incorporated fixes to numerous bugs. Thanks for reporting bugs
and/or prividing fixes!
